                        <p>The Coronavirus disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus affects each person differently. While some people do not develop any symptoms, others may suffer from severe health complications. However, not everyone contracting the COVID-19 virus may require hospitalisation. People with mild and moderate symptoms can be treated at home. Various organizations including the WHO and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) of India have laid out guidelines that will help people take care of COVID-19 patients at home.  </p>

                        <p>A COVID-19 infected person with mild or no symptoms would be examined by a healthcare professional, who would decide if the patient can be quarantined at home. As per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), US, one must have proper facilities at their residence, which may be required during home care. Things that are taken into account before considering home care for a COVID-positive patient include: </p>

                        <p>As per Government guidelines, a COVID-positive person needs to isolate themselves for 14 to 17 days. Tips that may help a caregiver take care of a COVID-positive person at home include:</p>

                        <p>One must be extremely careful while taking care of a person infected with COVID-19 disease as they are at a high risk of getting exposed to the virus. Wearing masks, following proper hand hygiene, and limiting physical contact with the patient would help in preventing the transmission of the virus. Getting vaccinated further reduces the risk of exposure to the virus. A specialist doctor can be remotely consulted for further advice and recommendations. </p>
